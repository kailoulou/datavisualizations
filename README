This is what you need to do in order to begin creating and testing your code. Please note that this currently works on Windows computers, I don't know about Macs which means paths and folder hierarchy will be different. With that in mind, the principles will be the same

1: Download XAMPP
2: Save XAMPP to your local disk
3: Run the .exe file
4: Navigate to the root folder for XAMPP (The place you chose to download XAMPP to)
5: Click on "htdocs"
6: Copy your current project folder and make a local copy there. Or just make a new folder titled however you want. HOWEVER AVOID SPACES
7: Great! Now you have the folder! Now go back to your XAMPP GUI
8: Initialize Apache, FileZilla, and Mercury and grant them admin priveleges (screw your antivirus)
9: When launching your file, go to your browser of choice (doesnt matter with this project, very low level stuff)
10: Place the following address in your search bar: 
https://localhost/(PROJECT FOLDER NAME)/(PROJECT FILE NAME HERE)


ADDITIONAL NOTES:
This code is currently slightly incomplete, still need to revise the SVGs and replace them when the user selects another button. 
If you include a space in your file name, you will need to type %20 to represent that space
